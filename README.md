# HCA-Morph
Deformable medical image registration is critical for longitudinal diagnosis and quantitative anatomical analysis. Existing iterative optimization approaches are computationally intensive and are sensitive to parameter tuning, while recent deep learning methods often face limitations in modeling spatial correspondences and fusing multi-level features. To address these challenges, we propose HCA-Morph, a novel unsupervised registration framework. It integrates two dedicated modules: (1) a Spatial Correspondence-Aware Module (SCAM), which explicitly models spatial alignment between moving and fixed images from local to global scales, and (2) a Cross-Scale Attention Module (CSAM), which adaptively fuses features across network layers for robust multi-level feature fusion. Experiments on two brain MRI datasets (OASIS and IXI) demonstrate Dice score improvements of up to 0.029 (OASIS) and 0.028 (IXI). Ablation studies confirm that SCAM and CSAM provide complementary benefits, jointly improving accuracy and robustness. Given its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, HCA-Morph holds strong clinical potential—for example, potentially supporting longitudinal monitoring of Alzheimer’s disease progression and assisting preoperative MRI planning by improving the alignment of critical deep structures.
